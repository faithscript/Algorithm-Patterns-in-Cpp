Given an array, find the length of the smallest subarray in it which when sorted will sort the whole array.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 2, 5, 3, 7, 10, 9, 12]
Output: 5
Explanation: We need to sort only the subarray [5, 3, 7, 10, 9] to make the whole array sorted

two pointer squeezing, move the left if the target is too small, move the right if the pattern is too big

kind of like

while(l < r){
    int sum = a[l] + a[r];
    if(sum < target){
        l++;
    }else{
        r++;
    }
}
