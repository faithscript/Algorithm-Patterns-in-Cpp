// Problem Statement
// Given the head of a LinkedList and a number ‘k’, reverse every alternating ‘k’ sized sub-list starting from the head.

// If, in the end, you are left with a sub-list with less than ‘k’ elements, reverse it too.

// Image
// Constraints:

// The number of nodes in the list is n.
// 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
// 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
